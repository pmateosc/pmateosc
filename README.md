# Hi! I'm Pablo Mateos
I studied Electronic and Automatic Engineering at UCLM. I have always liked getting involved in projects and jobs where I could learn and contribute my bit. I have participated in a university project to build an electric racing car from scratch! It was hard but awesome!

When I finished my studies, I started working in a big company as a developer of an RPA \(Robotic Process Automation\) technology and later as a Java developer. after 3 years in that company, I felt that I had stopped learning and that where I was I could not continue to evolve. Fortunately, I was presented with a super interesting project that I am currently working on. I work in a startup as a fullstack developer!! An incredible challenge in which I am learning a lot and I am enjoying a lot too!
